## ✨ Features

- 📝 User-friendly web interface for inputting loan application details
- 🧠 Advanced machine learning model for predicting loan approval
- 🐳 Dockerized for easy deployment and scaling
- 🔒 Secure handling of sensitive information

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [ ] Python 3.10+
- [ ] Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- [ ] Git

## 🚀 Local Development Setup

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/martinkilombe/loan-prediction-app.git
   cd loan-prediction-app
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to use the app.

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

1. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the necessary environment variables:
   ```env
   DEBUG=0
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
   DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost 127.0.0.1 [::1]
   SQL_ENGINE=django.db.backends.postgresql
   SQL_DATABASE=loanprediction
   SQL_USER=loanuser
   SQL_PASSWORD=loanpassword
   SQL_HOST=db
   SQL_PORT=5432
   DATABASE=postgres
   ```

3. Build and start the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. The app should now be running. Access it by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

## 📊 Usage

1. 📝 Fill out the loan application form with the required information.
2. 🖱 Click the "Predict" button to submit your application.
3. 🎉 Get instant feedback on whether your loan is likely to be approved or denied!

## 💡 How It Works

Our app uses a sophisticated machine learning model trained on historical loan data. Here's a simplified view of the prediction process:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Input] --> B[Data Preprocessing]
    B --> C[ML Model]
    C --> D{Prediction}
    D -->|Approved| E[Loan Likely Approved]
    D -->|Denied| F[Loan Likely Denied]
```

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

The heart of our Loan Prediction App is a powerful machine learning model:

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier, known for its high accuracy and ability to handle complex datasets.
- **Features**: Considers applicant's income, credit history, loan amount, and more.
- **Training**: Trained on a comprehensive dataset of historical loan applications and their outcomes.
- **Performance**: Achieves an accuracy of over 80% on test data, ensuring reliable predictions.

## 🛡️ Security

We take the security of your data seriously:

- All sensitive information is encrypted in transit and at rest.
- We use Django's built-in security features to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- User inputs are thoroughly sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
